# FinalCKP → Sovereign OS: Architecture

This is the canonical architecture document for the Chroma Key Protocol app. It
defines two things:

1. **The current architecture** (what is actually running today).
2. **The target architecture** (what the Sovereign OS migration is moving
   toward, per the FINALCKP → SOVEREIGN OS Implementation & Migration Guide).

Where the two differ, this doc says so explicitly. Do not assume the target
state is already implemented — check `SOVEREIGN_STATE_MAP.md` (Phase 2) and
the migration status notes below before relying on any target-architecture
component described here.

## Migration status

This repo has completed **Phase 1 (Repository Sanitization)**, **Phase 2
(State Inventory)**, and a first pass of **Phase 3 (Sovereign Runtime)** of
the Sovereign OS migration. The **current architecture** section above still
reflects the real, active system that ships to users — the runtime below is
new, standalone scaffolding that nothing in the app reads or writes yet.

Phase 2 produced `docs/SOVEREIGN_STATE_MAP.md`, a full inventory of every
existing state store (module progress, journal, declarations, audio state,
auth, curriculum registry, etc.) and its owner/persistence/consumers. It
found significant duplication — most notably **seven independent,
incompatible Reclamation-University progress-tracking systems** and **two
independently-writable stores for a user's `current_act`/`completed_acts`**
(Supabase Auth metadata vs. backend Postgres `users`), where the live UI
only writes one of them.

Phase 3 added `frontend/src/sovereign/runtime/` — a React Context +
`useReducer` runtime (`SovereignProvider`, `sovereignReducer`,
`sovereignActions`, `sovereignSelectors`, and the `useSovereign()` hook) with
the state shape and action set the migration guide specifies: `identity`,
`curriculum` (a registry of per-module `SovereignModuleState`), `module`
(the active module, exposed with bound `advanceStep`/`completeStep`),
`media`, `reflection`, `concepts`, `synthesis`, `artifact`, and `session`.
State only ever changes through the explicit actions in
`sovereignActions.js` (`startModule`, `advanceStep`, `completeStep`,
`recordReflection`, `selectConcept`, `connectConcepts`, `executeProtocol`,
`generateArtifact`, `sealArtifact`) — components never get a raw `dispatch`.
`sovereignReducer.test.js` covers the reducer's invariants (dedup on
repeated completions/concept selection, non-clobbering identity merges,
`sealArtifact` refusing to fire before a draft exists, etc.).

This runtime is intentionally **not wired into the app yet** — no existing
component imports it, and it does not yet replace any of the 13 duplication
findings in `SOVEREIGN_STATE_MAP.md`.

Phase 4 added `sovereignSteps.js`: the canonical 11-step curriculum
lifecycle (`01-intro` … `11-summary`) with **real, per-step completion
criteria** instead of navigation standing in for completion — the migration
guide's core rule ("Next" ≠ "complete"). `evaluateModuleSteps(state,
moduleId)` computes each step's status (`locked`/`active`/`complete`)
straight from runtime state: simple steps complete once viewed
(`module.viewedSteps`), `REFLECTION` requires an actual committed reflection
entry for that module, `PROTOCOL` requires a protocol execution tagged with
that `moduleId`, `ARTIFACT` requires the artifact to be sealed (not just
drafted), and `SUMMARY` requires every prior step to genuinely be done.
Steps lock in order — you can be on the first incomplete step, but you
can't skip ahead of it. Two things are explicitly flagged as placeholders in
code comments pending later phases: `KEY_CONCEPTS`'s criterion (any concept
selected anywhere, since concept selection isn't module-scoped until Phase
10's Concept Graph) and `ARTIFACT`'s criterion (the runtime has one global
artifact slot until Phase 14 defines how a per-module artifact review
relates to the single cross-journey Living Artifact). `sovereignSteps.test.js`
(9 tests) exercises this against the real reducer, including the exact
"advancing past a step doesn't complete it" case the guide calls out.

Phase 5 added `sovereignLocalPersistence.js` and wired it into
`SovereignProvider`: pass a `namespace` prop and the runtime restores state
from `localStorage` on mount (via `useReducer`'s lazy initializer, so
there's no restore-flash render) and debounce-saves it back (default 500ms)
on every subsequent change, plus flushes immediately on `beforeunload` and
on unmount so the last debounce window is never silently dropped. Storage is
dependency-injected — it falls back to `globalThis.localStorage`, then an
in-memory stub — so the whole thing is unit-tested (11 tests across
save/load round-tripping, version-mismatch and corrupted-JSON handling,
fail-soft behavior when storage throws, and debounce/flush/cancel timing
with fake timers) without needing a DOM or new test dependencies.
`namespace` is intentionally not defaulted to anything shared — it needs to
be scoped to the signed-in user once identity is wired up (Phase 7), or two
accounts on the same browser would see each other's local state; omitting
it disables local persistence entirely (e.g. for tests).

Phase 6 added `frontend/src/sovereign/events/`: a framework-free event bus
(`SovereignEventBus.js` — subscribe/subscribeAll/emit, bounded history, a
throwing listener can't break the runtime or block other listeners) plus
`mapActionToEvents.js`, which derives events from every dispatched action
rather than requiring each feature to hand-roll its own emission — the
structural fix for duplication finding #13 (two disconnected analytics
systems). `SovereignProvider` now routes every action through this mapper
and emits the resulting events automatically; `useSovereign().session`
exposes `subscribe`, `subscribeAll`, and `recentEvents` for consumers.

`STEP_COMPLETED` is the one event that isn't a simple 1:1 action mapping:
because a step's completion criteria (Phase 4) can depend on state written
by several different action types, `mapActionToEvents` diffs
`evaluateModuleSteps()` before/after *every* action and emits
`STEP_COMPLETED` for whichever steps just crossed into `complete` — direct
payoff of building Phase 4's real completion criteria before this phase's
event bus, per the migration guide's sequencing rule. Several event types
from the guide's taxonomy (`MEDIA_*`, `LYRIC_ANCHOR_SELECTED`,
`CONCEPT_OPENED`, `REFLECTION_STARTED`/`REFLECTION_UPDATED`,
`PROTOCOL_STARTED`) are defined in `eventTypes.js` but not yet emitted,
each commented with which later phase (9, 10, or 12) needs to exist first —
they depend on runtime pieces that don't have real actions yet.

Phase 7 connected Supabase. Two parts:

**Schema** — `supabase/migrations/20260822051703_create_sovereign_runtime_schema.sql`
adds the guide's seven tables (`sovereign_sessions`, `sovereign_module_state`,
`sovereign_reflections`, `sovereign_events`, `sovereign_concepts`,
`sovereign_connections`, `sovereign_artifacts`), mirroring the exact
conventions the existing `rec_uni_*` schema already established (RLS scoped
to `auth.uid() = user_id`, `gen_random_uuid()` PKs, an `updated_at` trigger).
Naming note documented in the migration itself: "sovereign_" here is this
migration's new runtime and is unrelated to the pre-existing "Sovereign
Mode" UI under `frontend/src/modules/sovereign/` and the generic
`getSovereignSupabase()` helper in `frontend/src/lib/supabase/`, which
predate this migration and mean something different. `synthesis.protocolExecutions`
deliberately has no table yet — Phase 6's event only carries
`{protocolId, moduleId}`, not the full protocol payload, so persisting it
properly belongs with Phase 13's Synthesis Engine instead of being done
lossily here now.

**Sync layer** — `frontend/src/sovereign/persistence/`:
- `sovereignRemoteMapping.js`: pure, round-trip-tested field mapping
  between runtime state and DB rows (snake_case <-> camelCase, plus
  reconstructing the `moduleId:promptId` reflection-entry keys and the
  per-module dict shape from flat row lists).
- `sovereignReconciliation.js`: the actual merge policy for local vs.
  remote state — whole-module-record adoption from whichever side was more
  recently active (never a field-by-field blend, which could produce an
  incoherent record), later-`updatedAt`-wins per reflection entry,
  set-union for concepts/connections (additive-only today, so nothing to
  conflict), artifact status-priority so a stale replica can never
  downgrade a sealed artifact, and local-wins-ties for identity/media so a
  stale remote snapshot can't hijack what's actively happening in the
  current session. This is the most rigorously tested module in the whole
  runtime (21 tests) since it's exactly Phase 19's "Test E: persistence
  failure" scenario made real.
- `sovereignSupabaseSync.js`: thin I/O (`fetchRemoteState`,
  `pushRemoteState`, and a debounced `createRemoteAutosave` mirroring Phase
  5's local autosave shape) following this codebase's existing
  `{ data, error }` convention from `lib/supabase/reclamationUniversity.js`,
  with the Supabase client dependency-injected so it's tested against a
  hand-built fake client rather than a live connection.

**Wired into `SovereignProvider`** via an opt-in `userId` prop (should match
whatever `namespace` is set to, so local and remote agree on whose data this
is): on mount, fetches remote state, reconciles it with local, and
dispatches the result through `hydrate()`; debounce-pushes state back on
every subsequent change (2s default). `session.syncStatus` tracks
`local -> syncing -> synced`, or `error` on a failed fetch — Supabase stays
additive persistence, never a hard dependency; local state keeps working
either way. 95/95 tests pass across Phases 3-7.

Per the migration guide's sequencing rule, the next step is Phase 8
(migrate Reclamation University onto this runtime) — the first phase that
touches any existing, live component, and the one that actually resolves
the duplication findings in `SOVEREIGN_STATE_MAP.md` rather than just
building the replacement alongside them.

                                   reflections/spins endpoints
```

Auth is Supabase-first: `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` authenticates
directly against Supabase Auth in the browser and gates routes on that state.
The FastAPI backend validates the Supabase access token passed from the
frontend for its own owned resources — it does not issue a competing
session. See `API_CONTRACT.md` for the backend's own bearer-token endpoint
contracts, and `CLAUDE.md` for the full architecture writeup this summarizes.

Existing state (module/scene progress, journal, declarations, listened
tracks, audio state, curriculum registry, etc.) is currently owned
independently by several different components/hooks — there is no single
runtime that owns state today. Phase 2 (`SOVEREIGN_STATE_MAP.md`) inventories
this in detail; that inventory, not this doc, is the source of truth for
"who owns what" until the Sovereign Runtime (Phase 3) exists.

Target stack, once migrated:

- **Frontend**: React + Vite, React Router, Tailwind / existing design
  system, Tone.js / Web Audio.
- **State**: Sovereign Runtime (React context/hooks) with local persistence
  and Supabase persistence.
- **Backend / Infrastructure**: Supabase (identity, database, RLS,
  persistent state, realtime) + Cloudflare (Pages, Workers, R2) for
  delivery, edge execution, and media. **FastAPI is removed completely** in
  the target state — Cloudflare Workers take over any edge/protected-API
  logic the backend currently owns.
- **External Media**: Spotify integration where appropriate.
- **AI**: VMA / AI services operate as consumers of Sovereign State (a
  read-only `SovereignContext`), not as an independent chatbot bolted onto
  the app.

The full phased path from current → target architecture (state inventory,
Sovereign Runtime, 11-step curriculum state machine, local-first autosave,
event bus, Supabase persistence, Reclamation University migration, media
runtime, concept graph, domain matrix, reflection/synthesis/artifact
pipeline, OS shell, visual layer, Cloudflare consolidation, VMA, testing,
and finally deleting the legacy architecture) is tracked phase-by-phase as
migration work proceeds. Each phase should only begin once the phase before
it is real and working — do not build a downstream layer (e.g. the Artifact
UI) on top of an upstream layer that's only faked (e.g. Synthesis State that
doesn't actually exist yet).

## Repository FastAPI/backend reference audit (Phase 1.1)

As of this phase, mentions of FastAPI/the Python backend across the repo
were classified as follows:

| Location | Classification | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/server.py`, `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/run.py`, `backend/requirements.txt`, `backend/tests/*` | Active code | Untouched — still the canonical, running backend |
| `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `API_CONTRACT.md` | Active, accurate documentation of the currently-running system | Kept, annotated with a pointer to this doc as the target architecture |
| `APP_FLOW_INFRA_ANALYSIS.md` | Historical analysis; the specific "two FastAPI patterns" split-brain it describes has already been resolved (`backend/app/main.py` is now a one-line shim) | Kept as history, annotated as resolved/historical |
| `memory/PRD.md` | Historical/original PRD (predates Supabase; still says "MongoDB") | Left as-is — historical record, not live guidance |
| `supabase/config.toml` | Unrelated — Supabase CLI's own auto-generated comment about its API server (PostgREST), not the FastAPI backend | No action |
| `frontend/src/services/certificates/bloomCertificateGenerator.js` | Active code; generic comment ("backend API"), not FastAPI-specific | No action |

Nothing was deleted in this pass. FastAPI removal is Phase 20 of the
migration guide and depends on every phase before it actually replacing its
responsibilities first.
