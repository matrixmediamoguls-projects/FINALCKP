                <strong>Polarity</strong> takes this movement to its extremes — not simply asking what is moving, but how
                opposite states turn out to be the same thing at different degrees, and what that gives you to work with.
                Later, <strong>Rhythm</strong> follows the movement across time: why it keeps returning in cycles, and how
                to work with those cycles instead of being thrown by them.
